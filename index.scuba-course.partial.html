      If you have already tried scuba diving, and you liked it, and you want to
      know more, be more independent under the water and dive in the places for
      certified divers, then the Open Water Diver diving course in Phuket is
      where you need to start.
      <br /><br />
      The course is divided into several parts: theory, practice, and of course,
      diving itself. It's simple: you go through all these parts of training in
      parallel: theory and practice in the pool or shallow water, and then real
      dives in the sea. During the training, you will learn everything that a
      diver should know: how the equipment works and how to use it and take care
      of it; where and when you can dive and how to plan your dives, how to swim
      under the water. You will learn so much that every day will bring you more
      and more vivid impressions!
