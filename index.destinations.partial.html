          Ideal for beginners. Experienced divers come here only to get in shape
          after long breaks between dives. The main advantages of Koh Racha Yai
          are: 20 km from Phuket, a shallow sandy bottom; clear, calm water and
          good visibility under water throughout the year.

        <p class="destinations__card-text">
          A limestone rock, which rises from a depth of 30 meters, its eastern
          slope is a gentle descent to the sandy bottom, the western is a sheer
          wall. The abundance of anemones and nutrient-rich water attract an
          incredible amount of tropical fish to Anemone Reef.

          King Cruiser is a large car ferry that sank in 1997 after a collision
          with the underwater part of Anemone Reef and turned into an artificial
          coral reef. Only certified divers can dive at King Cruiser. Perfect
          for those who like wreck diving and enjoy the mysteries of the sank
          ships.
