                    calm water and good visibility under water throughout the year.

                <h3>Anemone Reef</h3>
                <p>A limestone rock, which rises from a depth of 30 meters, its eastern slope is a gentle
                     descent to the sandy bottom, the western is a sheer wall. The abundance of anemones 
                     and nutrient-rich water attract an incredible amount of tropical fish to Anemone Reef.

                <h3>King Cruiser</h3>
                <p>King Cruiser is a large car ferry that sank in 1997 after a collision with the underwater 
                    part of Anemone Reef and turned into an artificial coral reef. Only certified divers 
                    can dive at King Cruiser. Perfect for those who like wreck diving and enjoy the mysteries 
                    of the sank ships.
