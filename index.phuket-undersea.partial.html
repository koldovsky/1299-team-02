  <p class="content__paragraph">
    If you have already tried scuba diving, and you liked it, and you want to
    know more, be more independent under the water and dive in the places for
    certified divers, then the Open Water Diver diving course in Phuket is where
    you need to start. The course is divided into several parts: theory,
    practice, and of course, diving itself. It's simple: you go through all
    these parts of training in parallel: theory and practice in the pool or
    shallow water, and then real dives in the sea. During the training, you will
    learn everything that a diver should know: how the equipment works and how
    to use it and take care of it; where and when you can dive and how to plan
    your dives, how to swim under the water. You will learn so much that every
    day will bring you more and more vivid impressions!
