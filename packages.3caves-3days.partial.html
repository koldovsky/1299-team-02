        The islands of Pi-Phi are like a small archipelago. The entire coastal
        strip of this province, along with countless islands along it, is
        limestone, which means karst. Nobody knows how many caves are located
        there, the rocks adjoin the sea and go into it, hundreds of islands
        along the coast are the tops of these rocks, and this whole mountainous
        country is penetrated by caves, both in the sea and on the coast.
