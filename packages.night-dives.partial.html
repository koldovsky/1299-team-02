    <p class="diving-services__description">
      Night diving is something you should try. The underwater world is
      spectacular at night! Diving under water at night differs from day
      programs not only by the illumination, but also by various marine life.
      All daytime fish freeze in a dream near the reefs or at the bottom, and
      predators go on a night hunt. The package includes: transfer from the
      hotel and back, snacks, drinks and fruits on the ship, 12 liter air tanks
      and cargo belts, all necessary equipment.
